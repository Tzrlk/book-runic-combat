All the active elements of this style have particular sounds associated with
them. Each combination of stance, grip, guard, and transitions from one to the

The language used for representing the sounds is Hangul, and it can be learned
fairly quickly using the [Learn Hangul in 20min][1] guide, or by utilising the
following resources:
